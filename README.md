# FinalYearProject

My thesis project for the final year of Uni: a "Meta Game Engine". Create and explore your own game by using AI Tools!

## Description
Officially titled as "Game Design and Development with Utilisation of GenAI Tools and their Cooperation to Enhance Player Experience", is a project I made for my final year of studies at York University.
This project is a game that creates a simple game for the player by using different AI tools.

The resulting game lets the player explore the environment and converse with an AI NPC that has knowledge of the generated environment. These games are saved locally on the player's machine and the player can choose which game they want to play at any time.

### Technologies
Unity (2022.3.14f1) with C#

### GenAI Tools
ChatGPT from OpenAI for Chatbot Functionality

SkyboxAI from BlockadeLabs for Environment Generation

Convai for AI NPC

## NOTE
The API Subscription plan for one of the GenAI Tools has been cancelled. Environments and games cannot be generated, making the project currently out of order and not functional.

## Showcase
Watch a short 3 minute youtube video showcasing the project [here](https://youtu.be/cj0hHs7AYfE)!

Additionally, here are some screenshots :D
